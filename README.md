# CoinDrip Protocol V2

This is the source code of the CoinDrip protocol V2. CoinDrip is the first token (ESDT) streaming protocol built on MultiversX. Instead of the regular token transfers, you can use CoinDrip to stream tokens each second toward a recipient.

Check out the [docs](https://docs.coindrip.finance) to get a high-level understanding of how CoinDrip works and ways you can integrate it in your project.

## ðŸ›  Usage

If you want to build the smart contract locally, make sure you have [mxpy](https://docs.multiversx.com/sdk-and-tools/sdk-py/installing-mxpy/) installed.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/CoinDrip-finance/protocol-v2
$ cd protocol-v2
$ cargo build
```

If you just want to use the CoinDrip protocol to stream tokens, consider checking out our dApp.

### ABI

Please follow the above steps to download and build the contract locally in order to generate the ABI.

### mx js sdk

If you're looking to interact with the CoinDrip protocol using [mx js sdk](https://github.com/multiversx/mx-sdk-js-core) you can check out [our examples](https://docs.coindrip.finance/technical-reference) from the docs under "Endpoints" and "Views".
